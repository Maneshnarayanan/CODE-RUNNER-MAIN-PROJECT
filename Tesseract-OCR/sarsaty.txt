El Document image binarization (thresholding) refers to the
conversion of a gray-scale image into a binary image. Two
categories of thresholding:

- Global, picks one threshold value for the entire
document image which is often based on an estimation
of the background level from the intensity histogram of
the image.

- Adaptive (local), uses different values for each pixel
according to the local area information
